3. Clicking in an experience opens up a much detailed view containing information like accessibility and Hospitality.
4. The Map initially shows the districts in the zoomed out view and upon zooming in, it then shows the individual markers.
5. Markers that overlap are shown as a cluster which can be clicked on to further zoom-in the map on them.
6. Experiences can also be filtered out based on certain selections.
7. Experiences can be searched for, based on the name, where suggestions are shown in a dropdown list.
8. Experience can be added to and removed from Favourites.
9. Recommendations are shown to the user in the form of call-to-actions based on the user activity.
